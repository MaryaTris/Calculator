Dreams do come true
She is a replica of a queen
Her smile
Her walk 
Like an angel
She oozes beauty 
And drives me crazy just with the whip of her hair
Days go by 
Memories still remain
Of… 
How you looked at me the first time we met
Your eyes full of excitement 
….And splendour 
Your smile 
……your face all lightened up
Full of the child in me and the love for you
My body all confused
Goosebumps 
Butterflies
I just yearned to touch
…..to satisfy my nerves
With a kiss
…a hug 
My ears vibrating to hear your voice
And the voice…. Sent chills down my spine
For a long time when my world came to a standstill I have been waiting for this day
This moment right here
And it was perfect…. Just perfect i tell you
I had done it… 
Met my dream… 
My dream.. 
Now it became reality… 
And I’d give my heart for that moment
That day
That exact second
When only you made sense to me
And love was….. Beckoning 
And I believed in fairy tales… 
….oh yeah…
